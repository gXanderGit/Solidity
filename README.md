Creating a token known as gXander in Solidity using smart contract

Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has two main functions that update the state of the contract called mint and burn. Any address can mint, but to burn, you need to burn from an address with enough funds. Feel free to play around.


Getting Started
The easiest way to get started is through the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/. Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., tokenContract.sol). Copy and paste the content of the tokencontract.sol code into the file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18", and then click on the "Compile tokenContract.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "tokenContract" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint function with a hex address and a value. You can also burn currency with these same parameters. Click on the "tokenContract" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "mint" or "burn" functions. Finally, click on the function name or variable to view it's value. Enjoy!
